## programming/ development/tech stack

- programming langauges: python, javascript
- agentic frameworks: Langchain, LangGraph, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel, AutoGen, OpenAI SDK agents, HuggingFace libraries, Amazon Bedrock
- structured output/input: Pydantic, JSON
- streaming : Webhooks
- session management: history, context of chat, Storage to S3/DynamoDB for each session


## llm concepts/best-practices

- evaluation frameworks (guardrails, groundedness, hallucination checks).
- design single/multi-agent architectures
- define agent roles (planner, researcher, retriever, executor, reviewer), 
- toolboxes, 
- handoffs, 
- memory strategy (short/long-term)
- supervisor policies for safe collaboration.
- structured output/input: Pydantic, JSON
- streaming : Webhooks
- prompting: single shot prompting, multi-shot prompting
- session management: history, context of chat, Storage to S3/DynamoDB for each session
- agentic patterns
- tooling, API call

## rapid prototyping

- Gradio, n8n, Streamlit

## build high-quality RAG: 

- implement ingestion, 
- chunking, 
- embeddings, 
- indexing, and 
- retrieval with evaluation (precision/recall, groundedness, hallucination checks), 
- guardrails, and citations.


## Productionize on AWS: 

- leverage services like Bedrock (Agents/Knowledge Bases/Flows) or equivalent LLM platforms, 
- Lambda, API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB, OpenSearch/Vector DB, 
- Step Functions, and CloudWatch for tracing and alerts.
- SageMaker for custom model hosting.
- Streaming : Webhook APIs
- Deployment: lambda, ECS/EC2
